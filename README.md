# AI Video Directory

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project that serves as a comprehensive directory for AI-powered video creation tools and services.

## Project Purpose

The AI Video Directory is designed to help content creators discover and compare various AI-powered tools and services for creating faceless video content. Key features include:

- A searchable database of AI video creation tools
- Detailed listings of services with descriptions and features
- User-friendly interface for easy navigation and comparison
- Ability for service providers to submit their tools for inclusion

This platform aims to streamline the process of finding the right AI video creation tools, saving time and effort for content creators in their workflow.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
